## Welcome to Home Inventory, my first Node.JS development project. I started this project to get myself a basic understanding of Node.JS, and I believe I've succeeded.

Deploy my code at your own risk.

 To start the API backend, use "npm run dev" in the project root. To start the frontend, navigate to the 'client' folder and run "npm start".

At this time, HomeINV requires a microsoft SQL server database backend. A .sql file is provided in the project root for you to create the necessary tables in a database named "Inventory". You will need to create a user with access to this database, and enter the credentials in a .env file in the project root- see server.js for expected paramaters.

Happy tinkering!
